# CSE 420
This is a repository of my lab solutions that I had to do for my CSE420: "Compiler Design" course at Brac University.

Lab2: Email or Web address differentiator   
Lab3: Regular Expression output validator  
Lab4: Lexical Analyzer to build a symbol table: Identifying method name and their return types in a piece of JAVA code
